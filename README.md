Education & Technology

Story Pitch - Describe the story you’re trying to tell  (~ 500 words). 
Word Count = 547

	In 1926, the first set of SAT’s was administered. 8000 students were allowed to register and results took between 3-6 weeks to return. This particular method proved as a major disadvantage to students who were not allowed to register and as such, 60% of the students who were able to take the test were upper-class males. Over the years, technology has improved to accommodate a diverse range of students. Today, the tests are marked by IBM-100 and sign-ups are administered digitally. While the advent of technology in the academic world is usually a problematic topic, the benefits and progression it has introduced are undeniable. As our world becomes increasingly digitized it is pertinent that other industries and sectors in the country catch up. Through technology, there has been a major advancement in the academic field through apps and software constructed to aid students such as Canvas and Microsoft.This project aims to examine the impact that technology has had on education. 
      While technology has inarguably provided numerous benefits, some of its faults which will be examined cannot be overlooked. Today, the benefits that technology provides towards both students' and teachers' academic journey are seemingly endless. It increases productivity in the classroom, enables a wider range of students to access important information and allows for easier facilitation of communication in the classroom. However, it is important to also acknowledge the faults of the system to improve it in the future. Through implementing digital-based classes, financially unstable students are left behind due to a lack of resources. Additionally, the introduction of technology as a means of communicating with each other can lead to students’ social skills being reduced.

	The topic of technology in education is a compelling story because it has the potential to significantly impact the way people learn as well as teach. While it can bring many benefits to the education system, the use of technology can reinforce existing inequalities and disparities in the education system. As students from disadvantaged backgrounds may not have necessary access needed for technologies such as computers or internet access. Underprivileged communities might also not have enough support or resources to properly learn how to use these technologies for academic success (digital literacy).  This phenomenon can amplify the existing digital divide as well as the education or achievement gap between 	privileged groups and marginalized groups, who are often facing social and economic challenges.
	Furthermore, with new artificial intelligence advancements, some concerns might arise that could lead students to rely on AI excessively, which will significantly affect their learning. Just like any other technology, AI can also negatively impact marginalized communities and reinforce existing inequalities as AI is mostly only accessible to privileged students with access to the internet and technologies. Artificial Intelligence can be a great resource and act as an academic advantage for one group of students, while causing an adverse effect on the rest. 
	Technology use for educational purposes is overall a highly relevant topic, especially nowadays as we live in a world that is technologically dependent. It is also an important discussion because of the way it shapes our educational system and impacts students from diverse backgrounds. Technology in education highlights the need to address inequalities in accessibility and resources for all students, regardless of their situation or demographic. 


Background Research & Inspo - Need at least 5 sources (articles, blogs, interactive visualizations)

Technology’s impact on learning -  New global data reveal education technology’s impact on learning | McKinsey
This article communicates technology’s relation with student outcomes in school through visuals and graphs. This was an inspiration for our project because we were able to visually see that technology has an effect on education. 
We also wanted to show through our project how the lack of technology can negatively impact someone’s academic performance/outcomes. This source was an inspiration as it  also compares technology use in education by region and demographics (some are more developed than others).

Covid-19 pandemic’s effect on education inequality - How COVID taught America about inequity in education – Harvard Gazette
This article highlights the disparities in education when it comes to technological resources and accessibility, these were more evident during the Covid-19 pandemic. Similarly, in our project, we will discuss how inequalities in education are highlighted with the use and need for technology. 
The article mentions how technology is essential in our society nowadays. This influenced our project because we decided to narrow down our topic from education to technology’s effects on education.

Achievement gap based on demographics (2019) - Comparing racial and ethnic gaps in the U.S. | Pew Research Center
This is an interactive map comparing achievement differences between different demographic groups. We took inspiration from this as it highlights the relation between poverty and education. 
While this source focuses on the achievement gap very broadly, our project will focus on education and socioeconomic gaps and their relations to technology access. 

Digital literacy in education - Advancing Digital Literacy for a Digitally Inclusive Future | EdSurge News
This article describes the importance of digital literacy in the education system. In our project we will highlight digital	literacy as it is an important part of inequalities and differences in opportunity in the education system.
The article also mentions strategies for teaching kids in school digital literacy, our project will discuss how not every community has access to this kind of education and how this creates bigger challenges later in life. 

Digital Equity Act - Mapping Digital Equity in Every State (census.gov)
This interactive map by the U.S census bureau highlights intersectionalities and barriers that prevent people from digital literacy. This inspired our project because it shows the complexity of learning.
This map takes into account disabilities as well as other language and cultural barriers that might make it difficult for someone to gain full digital literacy. Our project will highlight how inclusivity is important to avoid inequalities in the education system and academic technology use as well as this source does. 


Finding Data - need two datasets to start from two different sources! Describe datasets with questions provided

1. Students and computers - https://www.oecd-ilibrary.org/snapshot-of-the-relation-between-computer-use-at-school-and-performance-in-computer-based-assessments_5jrw5q6fj8ns.xls?itemId=%2Fcontent%2Fcomponent%2F9789264239555-table6-en&mimeType=vnd.ms-excel  (book pdf which includes datasets)  

-Where did you download the data (e.g., a web URL)? 9789264239555-en.pdf (oecd-ilibrary.org)
-The data was collected by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development. The source includes data on whether access to information and -technology affects student learning.
-How many observations (rows) are in your data? 30
-How many features (columns) are in the data? 6

2. Students Perceptions Of AI in Education

-Where did you download the data (e.g., a web URL)? https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/gianinamariapetrascu/survey-on-students-perceptions-of-ai-in-education
-The data was downloaded from a site named “Kaggle”. The data in the research presented was collected through an online survey conducted in social media groups and was conducted by a student. The survey aimed to gather information on the thoughts of undergraduate students enrolled in the 2nd and 3rd year of study at the Faculty of Cybernetics, Statistics, and Economic Informatics and whether or not they believe artificial intelligence impacts education
-How many observations (rows) are in your data? = 91
-How many features (columns) are in the data? =  35
