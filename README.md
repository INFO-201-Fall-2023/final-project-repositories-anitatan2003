Quality of Life in the US

Story Pitch - Describe the story you’re trying to tell  (~ 500 words). 
We all know and understand that the quality of life has significantly improved over the past couple of decades. But, what do trends, numbers, and statistics have to show about this fact? Although quality of life is inherently a subjective measure of an individual’s well-being, we have developed a general definition that analyzes standards of living in the United States from the years of 1984 to 2019. We will analyze housing prices, usage of SNAP food benefits, life expectancy, cereal production, and GDP. It is anticipated that these values slowly improve throughout the decades, but are there any surprising trends that we may find to tell us something that isn’t shown with numbers alone?

Background Research & Inspo 

1. https://www.berkeleywellbeing.com/quality-of-life.html: This article talks about the theory and research surrounding quality of life.

2. SNAP Is Linked with Improved Nutritional Outcomes and Lower Health Care Costs | Center on Budget and Policy Priorities (cbpp.org): New and emerging research links the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP, formerly food stamps), the nation’s most important anti-hunger program, with improved health outcomes and lower health care costs. This research adds to previous work showing SNAP’s powerful capacity to help families buy adequate food, reduce poverty, and help stabilize the economy during recessions.

3. US Health Map | Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation (healthdata.org): Explore health trends in the US at the county level between 2000 and 2019 for life expectancy by race and ethnicity and mortality by race and ethnicity

4. Frontiers | How Do Housing Prices Affect Residents' Health? New Evidence From China (frontiersin.org):This paper aims to explore the effect and mechanism of rising housing prices on residents' physical and mental health. Using data from the China Family Panel Studies from 2014 to 2018, we investigate the impact and mechanism of rising housing prices on the mental and physical health of urban residents through multiple grouping regression and analysis of variance. 

5. US GDP over time (usafacts.org): Observing GDP can tell how the economy is doing. A growing GDP implies an improving economy. This website provides plots for the changes in US GDP.
